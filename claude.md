## Project: RunScheduler - Weekly Training Planner

### Overview
This project implements a deterministic weekly training planner for marathon runners, featuring intelligent quality session scheduling around Sunday-anchored long runs. It was built with Claude Code Assistant to solve the "greedy scheduler bug" by implementing bilateral neighbor spacing checks.

### Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **TypeScript Planner Engine** (`src/planner.ts`)
   - Deterministic scheduling algorithm
   - Bilateral neighbor spacing validation
   - Auto-upgrade logic (Long Easy â†’ Big Easy at 21+ miles)
   - Weight-based priority sorting with stable tiebreakers

2. **Next.js UI** (`web/`)
   - Interactive week calendar grid
   - Real-time schedule updates
   - Dark mode support
   - Export to calendar (ICS)
   - Local storage for saved plans

### Key Algorithm Features

#### The Greedy Bug Fix
The original greedy algorithm only tracked the last placed session, preventing optimal placement when a lighter session could go before a heavier one.

**Solution**: When placing a session on day `d`, check spacing against both:
- **Nearest left** scheduled session
- **Nearest right** scheduled session

This ensures constraint satisfaction for all neighbors, not just chronological order.

#### Scheduling Rules
1. **Sunday is always long run** (no quality sessions)
2. **Long-run buffers** block days before/after based on type:
   - Easy (1/1): Sat before, Mon after
   - Progressive/Hilly/Big (2/2): Fri-Sat before, Mon-Tue after
   - MP (2/3): Fri-Sat before, Mon-Wed after
3. **Per-session lead-in**: Each quality needs X consecutive easy days before
4. **Pairwise spacing**: Between qualities A and B, require sufficient recovery days
5. **Deterministic ordering**: Weight desc â†’ selection index â†’ alphabetical

### Quality Catalog

| Quality Type | Before | After | Weight | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Medium-long easy (90â€“105â€²) | 0 | 1 | 1 | Extended aerobic run with next-day easy buffer |
| Threshold (split or 25â€“40â€² continuous) | 1 | 1 | 2 | Cruise reps or continuous steady state |
| Fartlek / medium hills (e.g., 1â€²/1â€² Ã— 30â€“40â€²) | 1 | 1 | 2 | Rolling fartlek or moderate hill session |
| VOâ‚‚ micro (30/30s, 12â€“18â€² on-time) | 1 | 1 | 2 | Short VOâ‚‚ alternations capped near 18â€² |
| MP (alternations, ~30â€“45â€² MP total) | 2 | 2 | 4 | Marathon pace alternations totalling 30â€“45â€² |
| VOâ‚‚ big (e.g., 5Ã—1k or 6Ã—800 @ ~5k) | 2 | 2 | 4 | Classic VOâ‚‚ session with full 5k reps |
| MP big (continuous â‰¥45â€² at MP) | 2 | 3 | 5 | Extended continuous marathon pace effort |
| Long progression / MP-lite finish (last 15â€“25â€² steady/MP-lite) | 2 | 2 | 4 | Long run finishing with steady or MP-lite segment |

### Test Coverage
25 comprehensive Jest tests covering:
- Long-run blocking patterns
- Lead-in window validation
- Bilateral spacing enforcement
- Auto-upgrade logic
- Determinism verification
- Edge cases (empty selections, unknown keys)

### UI Features

#### Visual Week Grid
- Color-coded days:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Quality scheduled
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Blocked (recovery)
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple: Sunday long run
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Easy/available
- Hover tooltips with details
- Today indicator

#### Smart Configuration
- Long run type selector with distance slider
- Auto-upgrade warning at 21+ miles
- Visual buffer preview
- Searchable quality selector with intensity badges

#### Training Analytics
- Weekly load calculation
- Motivational quotes based on load
- Session count tracking
- Export to calendar (ICS)
- Save/load previous plans

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd web && npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start UI
